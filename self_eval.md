# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? 
    When you need the program to make a decision based on the available information stored in variables, so that it knows what to do next. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? 
    I would make sure that I double checked what I did ***before*** submitting the link. I made a mistake in my own organization system, and thought I had finished and submitted everything properly, but I misread something and I wasn't done. I had the time to double check, but for some reason I didn't. Lesson learned. I'm glad it was pointed out to me. Thank you Cydnee!
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? 
    I am getting more comfortable with the shortcuts, which is very helpful. I'm the most happy with not really needing to look at my notes for most of the tasks and being able to remember how to do almost everything in this assignment.
