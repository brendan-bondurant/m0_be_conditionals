# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? When you need the program to make a decision based on the available information stored in variables, so that it knows what to do next. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? I'm not 100% sure that I did the order correctly, because of where readme is in the list. When I forked the file initially I read the setup and went through the directions, however I am now wondering why the readme file was listed as 3rd.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? I am getting more comfortable with the shortcuts, which is very helpful. I'm the most happy with not really needing to look at my notes for most of the tasks and being able to remember how to do almost everything in this assignment.
